# German notes 

## Basics 1 

#### Capitalizing Nouns 
In German, **all nouns are capitalized**. 
Example: mein **N**ame, der **A**pfel 

#### German genders 
| gender | indefinite article |
| --- | --- |
| masculine | **ein** Mann | 
| neuter | **ein** Mädchen | 
| feminine | **eine** Frau |

#### Conjugation of regular verbs 
| English person | ending | German example |
| --- | --- | --- | 
| I | -e | ich trink**e** | 
| you (singular <br>informal) | -st | du trink**st** | 
he/she/it | -t | er/sie/es trink**t** | 

#### Conjugation of the verb sein (to be) 
| English | German | 
| --- | --- | 
| I am | ich **bin** | 
| you (singular informal) are | du **bist** | 
| he/she/it is | er/sie/es **ist** | 

#### Umlauts 
| no umlaut | umlaut | 
| --- | --- |
| a | ä | 
| o | ö | 
| u | ü | 

A workaround is to type "oe" instead of "ö".
In German, there's **no continuous aspect**. There are no separate forms for "I drink" and "I am drinking". There's only one form: _Ich trinke_.

## Basics 2 

In German, the **plural form does not depend on what gender** the singular form is.  
Regardless of grammatical gender, **all plural nouns take the definite article  _die_**.  
Just like in English, there's **no plural indefinite** article.  

| English | German |
| --- | --- |
| a man | ein Mann |
| men | Männer |

#### You, you and you 
In German, when  **addressing a single person, use  _du_**:  
    -   _Du_  bist mein Kind. (_You_  are my child.)  
If you are talking to  **more than one person, use  _ihr_**:  
    -   _Ihr_  seid meine Kinder. (_You_  are my children.)
