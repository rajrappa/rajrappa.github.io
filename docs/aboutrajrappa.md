### About > This Site 
There are two aspects of this topic. One is, about the name, "Rajrappa", and second, about this site.  
First the name.  
Rajrappa is a place in the eastern part of India. It is a small place in the state of Jharkhand. For me, it is the most beautiful place in this whole wide world, in all the worlds. I cannot really tell you my relation with this place. I cannot tell you anything about me. But I can tell you about this place. This place called Rajrappa.  
So, the place gets its name from a temple not very far from the colony. Colony is where everyone lives. Everyone, who works in the coal mines. Coal mines, which is situated in this place.  
The temple is about 8 kms from the colony. It is said that about 100 years ago docoits used to roam here. It is said that the docoits would sit in the temple premises and divide their loot among themselves.  
This place is a part of my existence. It will remain so long after this place would have ceased to exist.  
The second aspect is this site itself. This site is my place. And so, I have named it after the most beautiful place in this whole wide world, in all the worlds.
